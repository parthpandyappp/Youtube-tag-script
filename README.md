# Youtube-tag-script
This is a python script which enables a user to have a file as an output as a result of a fedded input file which has all it's contents with a comma at the end of every line. This is a very useful script as for instance, a person wants to add keywords which he has imported from any externam source has it's contents not separated by commas the computer might get confused :confused: as to consider the content as a whole or the words different as a keyword, then this script does provide a comma at every line of content of that file so that computer can easily dishtinguish different words.:smiley:

This script enhances the process of search engine optimization.:sunglasses:

### How can you obtain the output ?
1. Run that yt-tag-scrpt.py.
2. Input your input file path and the name of output file in which you want your desired output in the command line.
3. Have an output file with contents ending with commas at each line in your desired output filepath.
